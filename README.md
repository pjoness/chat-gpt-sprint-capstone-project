Wizeline Academy ChatGPT Sprint Capstone Project

Description
This Streamlit app provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with OpenAI's language model and Pinecone vector stores. Users can input queries and receive responses generated by OpenAI's language model based on the information stored in the Pinecone vector store.

Features
Interactive Interface: Users can input queries using the provided text area.
Response Generation: The app generates responses to queries using OpenAI's language model.
Vector Store Integration: Pinecone vector stores are employed for similarity-based retrieval.
Security: OpenAI API keys are securely handled, and users are prompted to input their key for authentication.
Usage
Setup:

Install required dependencies: openai, pinecone, langchain, streamlit.
Obtain API keys for OpenAI and Pinecone.
Replace the placeholder OpenAI API key in the Streamlit app section.
Run the App:

Execute the module to launch the Streamlit app.
Access the app in your browser (usually at http://localhost:8501).
Interact:

Enter text in the provided text area.
Click the "Submit" button to generate a response.
Note:

Ensure proper handling and security of API keys.
Refer to OpenAI and Pinecone documentation for more information.
Dependencies
openai: OpenAI's Python library for language models.
pinecone: Pinecone's Python client for vector stores.
langchain: Custom module for vector stores, embeddings, language models, and retrieval chains.
streamlit: Streamlit library for creating interactive web apps.
Example Usage
python
Copy code
# Example usage of the Streamlit app
from your_streamlit_module import initialize_vectorstore, generate_response

openai_api_key = "your_openai_api_key"
INDEX_NAME = "langchain-retrieval-augmentation"

# Initialize vector store
vectorstore = initialize_vectorstore(index_name=INDEX_NAME, openai_api_key=openai_api_key)

# Generate and display response
generate_response(query="What is the capital of France?", vectorstore=vectorstore, openai_api_key=openai_api_key)
Additional Information
This app assumes a secure handling of API keys.
Ensure valid permissions and quota limits for OpenAI and Pinecone API usage.
Check for updates in the OpenAI, Pinecone, and langchain libraries.
For troubleshooting, refer to the respective documentation of OpenAI, Pinecone, and Streamlit.
